Ellis Island is a five-member Fairfield-based rock band with an extensive
song list made up of some of the most iconic and impactful music from the
'80's to today. We cover a [wide array of bands](/song-list.html) from Pink
Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, and Bruce Springsteen to Radiohead, The
Black Crowes, Pearl Jam, and Foo Fighters.

Ellis Island has been playing throughout Fairfield and New Haven Counties
for over a decade. The band plays extensively at a range of public events,
porch fests, festivals, bars, breweries, and other venues, as well as
private parties and fundraisers in southern CT. Ellis Island will bring a
powerful, high energy, and memorable performance wherever they play.

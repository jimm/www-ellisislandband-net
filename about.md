# About Ellis Island

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-right: 3em;">
      Ellis Island is made up of musicians with diverse backgrounds and
      musical histories. Combined, they have more than a century of
      experience playing for audiences from upstate New York down to Alabama
      and Florida and across the ocean in London.
      <br/><br/>
      Ellis Island is rooted in an earlier incarnation (abomination?) called
      King's Pudding that existed back around 2008. The band entered the
      music scene with a bang....well, more of a thud. During its first
      outdoor gig, an overly excited guest lead singer kicked a monitor off
      stage into a group of young children. Mayhem ensued. Luckily there
      were no deaths, but it forced the band to immediately go into hiding.
      Re-emerging with a new name and a new face or two, the band made its
      mark on the local scene &mdash; they were the new bad boys and girl
      of Fairfield rock!
